# numbers are inmutable datatypes in python 
# they can be further classified as integer, float and complex

# integer 
#  int() function is a built- in function to create an integer object
#integers are numbers without decimal values

a = int()
b = 2
c = -12

#float () function is built in function to create a float

a = float()
b = 2.0
c = 3.1
d = 2e3
print(d) #2000.0
e = -33.33

#complex 
# they are the numbers with imaginary values
# complex() function is used to create complex data types

a= 2 + 3j
print(a)   # 2+3j

b = 4j
print(b)
 
d = -5j
print(d)
